________________________________________________________________________________
Lock-Talk is a console messenger based on TCP sockets and the TLS protocol for 
encrypting messages. 

There is no need to transfer certificates to each other; 
the client and server will generate them and do it for you. 

All you have to do is indicate the information in the certificates, 
wait and start communicating :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the *_init.py files are needed not only for passing certificates, but also 
for message coloring, since they contain methods to implement this idea. 
Their code has also been changed for greater cleanliness and stability. 
After receiving the certificates, the client and server establish a shared 
key and encrypt messages based on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. 
The dialogue will continue until the client or server is disabled using 
the ctrl+C command.

Also, the init.py files create a key and certificate using the openssl library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    LAUNCH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Server lauch

// You need to specify an argument: through which port the server will 
// communicate with the client. If you do not specify it, you will 
// be prompted for a port automatically upon startup.

python3 server.py <Port for transferring certificates> <Messaging port>
// or
python3 server.py

// Then he will ask you for information to obtain a certificate. Enter as you wish.

// You will then be presented with a blank line where you can enter something, 
// but it will not respond. This is the client's expectation.

// -----------------------------

// Client connection

// When running, you need to specify the arguments: Host and port. 
//If you do not specify them, the program will request them from you automatically.

python3 client.py <Host> <Port for transferring certificates> <Messaging port>
// or
python3 client.py


// Then he will ask you for information to obtain a certificate. Enter as you wish.

// Now they will exchange certificates, connect to each other and you can 
//start your hidden communication.

________________________________________________________________________________
1. Now the *_init.py files are needed not only for passing certificates, but also 
   for message coloring, since they contain methods to implement this idea.
2. Added customization.
3. The code has become more readable.
4. A debugger has been added that allows you to view information about the 
   initialization process, as well as the ability to customize it.
5. The names of the initialization scripts, as well as their code, 
   have been changed for greater cleanliness and stability.
6. Added customization implementation for Windows OS.
7. Documentation changes.
